                Been a bit since the first post, but I'm back! I don't have that much for this post, but I've started to mess around in arch linux. It's an interesting experience, very glitchy because I'm doing it in a VM, but it's better than nothing, thats for sure. I don't have any other device to mess around with linux with so VMs are my current preferred option. Arch is a really good way to understand the inner workings of a computer, I've learned. I spent hours just trying to get a single working desktop environment (I chose KDE Plasma, for those wondering), and even then it doesn't work very well. Firefox just chooses to lag out, and inhale all 4 of the cores on my i9 that I've dedicated to it. But that's what you get when you use Arch Linux, a very powerful but very difficult to use operating system. Gonna try to get a more custom environment, don't really know how to do it yet, but that's where the fun is! Learning how to do it, and learning about the operating system was my main goal of setting up the VM in the first place, after all.<br><br>

                In other news, I've also started learning guitar funnily enough. Yeah, very generic, I know, but its fun. Self teaching is hard, but it's my primary way of learning things. I just prefer it for some reason, no clue why. I guess it's just more satisfying to know that you figured out how to do something by yourself, with no assistance from others. But anyways, the site's got some minor visual changes, such as the dropdown actually rendering properly now, and a few spacing changes were also made! Of course, this post wasn't very important or interesting, but it was just a minor update on my current situation and some updates overall. I'm really excited to get into arch, and to figure out how to use it properly, customize it to the way I like, and make it just my own personal OS. So yeah, that's all!<br><br>-Evelyn
